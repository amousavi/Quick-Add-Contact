# QuickAddContact
This is an Android for managing new contacts. It saves them in a temp list and allows you message or call them from there, or dump them into real contacts.

It stores the timestamp, but there have been requests to store GPS coordinates as well.

Open with android studio, should be runnable out of the box.

## TO DO

GPS
better storage of contact files (dumps serializable list to local storage)
swipe contact actions (left to delete, right to text?)
